Alternative Design\n\n2.1. Advantages of proposed design\n2.1.1 Clarity\nTitle tells a better story of what is to be expected from the graph and subtitle is used to annotate the overall chart\nInstead of raw import and export data, this graph uses of Net Export formula (Export - Import) to illustrate the impact of Import and Export trades\n2.1.2 Aesthetics\nAesthetically, a simple line chart shows a better trends between the 6 countries\n3.0. Proposed Data Visualization\nActual Data Visualization can be viewed at\n4.0. Data Visualisation Step-by-Step\n4.1. Data Preparation in Excel\nFilter out the 6 countries (Hong Kong, Mainland China, Japan, Malaysia, Taiwan and United States) from Import Worksheet. \nRetrieve data from Year 2019 Jan to Year 2020 Dec \nRepeat Step 1 and 2 again for Export worksheet\nConsolidate the data into a new worksheet \nTranspose data \nReorganize data into a new worksheet (Data), consisting only 4 columns (Period, Country, Import and Export) \n4.2.

The data set consists of 13 variables and 6497 observations. For the purpose of this exercise, we have combined the red wine and white wine data into one data file. It is called wine_quality and is in csv file format.\n3.1 Importing Data\nFirst, let us import the data into R by using read_csv() of readr package.\nR code\nwine <- read_csv(“data/wine_quality.csv”)\nNotice that beside quality and type, the rest of the variables are numerical and continuous data type.\n4.0 Univariate EDA with Histogram\nIn the figure below, multiple histograms are plottted by using ggplot() and geom_histogram() of ggplot2 package. Then, ggarrange() of ggpubr package is used to patch these histogram into a single figure to reveal the distribution of the selected variables in the wine quality data sets.\nRcode\nfa <- ggplot(data=wine, aes(x= fixed acidity)) + geom_histogram(bins=20, color=“black”, fill=“light blue”) va <- ggplot(data=wine, aes(x= volatile acidity)) + geom_histogram(bins=20, color=“black”, fill=“light blue”) ca <- ggplot(data=wine, aes(x= citric acid)) + geom_histogram(bins=20, color=“black”, fill=“light blue”) rs <- ggplot(data=wine, aes(x= residual sugar)) + geom_histogram(bins=20, color=“black”, fill=“light blue”) ch <- ggplot(data=wine, aes(x= chlorides)) + geom_histogram(bins=20, color=“black”, fill=“light blue”) fSO2 <- ggplot(data=wine, aes(x= free sulfur dioxide)) + geom_histogram(bins=20, color=“black”, fill=“light blue”) tSO2 <- ggplot(data=wine, aes(x= total sulfur dioxide)) + geom_histogram(bins=20, color=“black”, fill=“light blue”) density <- ggplot(data=wine, aes(x= density)) + geom_histogram(bins=20, color=“black”, fill=“light blue”) pH <- ggplot(data=wine, aes(x= pH)) + geom_histogram(bins=20, color=“black”, fill=“light blue”) sulphates <- ggplot(data=wine, aes(x= sulphates)) + geom_histogram(bins=20, color=“black”, fill=“light blue”) alcohol <- ggplot(data=wine, aes(x= alcohol)) + geom_histogram(bins=20, color=“black”, fill=“light blue”)\nggarrange(fa, va, ca, rs, ch, fSO2, tSO2, density, pH, sulphates, alcohol, ncol = 4, nrow = 3)\n\n\n\n",

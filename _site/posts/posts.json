Data Visualisation Step-by-Step4.1. Data Preparation with Excel and Tableau\n4.2 Creating Chart\n\n5.0. Final Visualization5.1. Snapshot of Graph\n5.2. Major Observation and/or derived Insights\n\n\n1.0 Critiques on the original design\nThis is the original design to illustrate Singapore’s Merchandise Trade Performance with Major Partners in 2020 \n1.1 Clarity\n(a) Incomplete axis labelling of both x-axis and y-axis: Although bubble chart label notation indicates ‘Bil’ (which means Billion), we are unclear if x-axis and y-axis are in ‘Bil’ units too as the units are missing from both x-axis and y-axis. Moreover, axis labelling (Import & Export) are placed at the bottom left corner of the chart which can cause confusion as to which axis is Import and Export. This can be improved by placing it at the end of the axis instead.\n(b) Unclear label notation on bubble chart: Each countries are accompanied with a value label notation. However, we will not be able to differentiate whether this value is referring to total merchandise trade value or Net-Net value.\n(c) Missing chart title:  Title is missing from this chart and we are not able to determine what is this chart trying to tell us without looking at Department of Statistics website. We would not have known that this chart is a representation of Singapore Merchandise Trade Performance with majoring Partnering partners in which year or across which years.\n1.2 Aesthetics\n(a) Bubble overlapping: This is a interactive bubble chart as seen in Department of Statistics website. However, at first glance or without interacting with the chart, we are unable to view all the white circles (which indicating whether is it Net-Exporter or Net-Importers). It is hidden by overlapping solid colored bubble. This aesthetic leads to the clarity of the chart.\n(b) No focus area is highlighted: The bubble chart aesthetics are colorful, However, the graph looks cluttered and no focus point. Instead of using solid colors for all partners and introducing additional symbols into the chart with side note, the bubble chart colors should be darker for Taiwan and Hong Kong to bring the focus on this 2 partners and a lighter color for the rest and a small text notation beside Taiwan and Hong Kong to indicate Top Net Importer/Exporter\n(c) Interactive Design does not have much feature:  This chart is an interactive chart, however, if we are looking at multiple years, there is no features to view other years.\n2.0. Alternative Design\n\n2.1 Clarity\n(a) A Short Description in title section:  Write a short description to describe what is kind of information is this chart protraying. For example, is it indicating Net Importer/Exporter or Total Merchandise Trade value.\n(b) Proper Labelling on x and y-axis:  Since the data are revolving around billions unit, it is best to add the unit (B) to x and y axis’s markers.\n(c) Add filter for interactive design:  We are looking at a range of 10 years data, therefore it is best to have a year filter to navigate and see the transition from year to year for a better user experience.\n2.2 Aesthetics\n(a) Introduce opacity to bubble chart: Add opacity level of 20-30% to introduce transparency to bubble chart in case of overlapping points.\n(b) Bubble chart color scheme:  Intead of using different solid colors for different countries as per what DoSS has done, I introduce a red-blue diverging color scheme to different between Net Importer and Net Exporter. For points below the line will be colored closer o dark red and points above the line will be colored close to dark blue.\n(c) Reduce the number of colors and symbols:  As compared to the original graph from DoSS, it is flushed with numerous colors and there is no focus points. In my proposed visualisation, I opted for a simple and clean chart to protray the information. This way, it will not be too cluttered and would not confused the readers.\n3.0. Proposed Data Visualization\nRaw data are available at DoSS, under sub-section of Merchandise Trade by Region/Market.\nActual Data Visualization can be viewed at Tableau Public here\n4.0. Data Visualisation Step-by-Step\n4.1. Data Preparation with Excel and Tableau\nDownload and Open Excelsheet from DoSS\nRemove Unnecessary rows\nRename worksheet T1 to ‘Import’ and T2 to ‘Export’\n\nOne of the partners which we are interested on is European Union. However, the data is in Text format and Billion dollars.\nChange the change from ‘Text’ to ‘Number’\n\nCreate a new row in excel to convert European Union to Thousand Dollars unit. Input the formula (=IF(B7<>“na”, B7 * 1000, “na”)) and apply it to the whole row \nImport the excel data into Tableau \nDrag & Drop “Import” Data Source into the blank space \nProceed to Filter out the 10 Trading Partners (European Union, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Japan, Malaysia, Mainland China, Republic of Korea, Taiwan, Thailand, United States)\nClick on Filter at the top right hand corner \nClick on “Add” to select the variables of which we want to filter the data from \nSelect Variables (Which is essentially our trading partners) and Click OK \nSelect the 10 trading partners (Be mindful to choose “European Union (Thousand Dollars)” instead of “European Union (Million Dollar)”) \nSeparate out trading partner with dollar units\nClick on the little triangle and choose “Custom Split” \nInput “(” in ‘Use the Separator’ \nRename the newly created split column to your intended name by click on the little triangle > Rename \nHide all unused columns\nHold onto “Cntrl” key on the keyboard (“Command” for Mac) and select the year from 1976 Jan to 2010 Dec, 2021 Jan to 2021 May > Click on the little triangle > Hide \nRe-arrange data such that Period are gathered in 1 single column, per country\nHold down on Cntrl key and Select 2011 Jan to 2020 Dec > Click on little triangle > Pivot \nSave the edited data into a CSV file. Click on Sheet 1 at the bottom tab > Right Click on the Data “Import(outputFile)” > Export Data to CSV > Export \nRepeat Step 6 to 11 for “Export” trade Data\nThe next step is to merge both “Import” and “Export” CSV trade data together\nOpen “Export” CSV file, Copy and Paste it to a new worksheet in “Import” CSV file \nSave the CSV file (Final_output.xlsx) as XLSX to save both worksheet into 1 excel file \nImport (Final_output.xlsx) into Tableau \nCombine “Import” and “Export” worksheet into 1 datasource\nDouble click on “Import” and the screen will display “Import is made of 1 table” \nDrag & Drop “Export” next to Import. A venn diagram symbol is created between “Import” and Export\"\n\n4.2 Creating Chart\nNavigate to a new sheet in Tableau.\nCreate new parameters (Total Import and Total Export) Analysis > Create Calculated Field For “Total Import”: SUM([Import Amt]) For “Total Export”: SUM([Export Amt]) \nDrag & Drop “Total Import” to Rows and “Total Export” to Columns \nCreate another Calculated field for Total Merchandise Trade Amount Analysis > Create Calculated Field “Total Trade Amt”: SUM([Import Amt]) + SUM([Export Amt]) \nDrag & Drop “Total Trade Amt” to Size, and click on “Size” and adjust the slider \nCreate another calculated field Analysis > Create Calculated Field “Net Importer”: [Total Import] - Total Export \nDrag & Drop “Net Importer” to Color \nEdit the colors of the bubble plot\nAt the right panel, find “AGG(Net Importer)” and click on the little triangle > Edit Colors \nChoose Red-Blue Diverging \nCheck “Use Full Color Range” and Click OK \nClick on Colors and change teh opacity of the bubble color\n\nBuild Filters for Period\nDrag & Drop Period into Filters \nSelect “Years” and click Next >\n\nSelect all 10 of 10 values and click OK\n\nBuild filter for Country\nDrag & Drop Country into Filter \nSelect all 10 countries and click OK\n\nDisplay the filter Under Filter > Click on little triangle > Show Filter (Do it for YEAR(Period) and Country)\n\nEdit the filter display type\nOn the right panel:\n“Year” - click on little triangle > Single Value (Slider)\n“Country” - Click on little triangle > Multiple Values (List)\n\nRemove “All” from Year Filter.\nClick on little triangle > Customize > Uncheck “Show”All\" Value\"\n\nAdding Reference Line to differentiate Net Importer and Net Exporter\nAnalysis > Create Calculated Field\n\nDrag & Drop “Reference Line” on Rows \nAdjusted the Properties for Reference Line\nDrag & Remove all properties except “Country” in details\nChange from Circle to Line Chart\nChange the Size to the smallest\nChange the color to black\n\nRight click on the line chart > Trend Lines > Show Trend Lines \nOnce you have done the above step correctly, it will look like this \nHowever, if you notice, the diagonal line is not drawing end to end.\nRight click on the axis > Edit Axis\n\nSelect “Fixed” and change the Fixed end to 8.5B\n\nA perfect diagonal line is drawn \nGo to the Row sections > Click on the little triangle > Dual Axis\n\n\nAdjust the trend line properties\nRight Click on the trend line > Format\nGo to “Trend Line” and Select dash line and slimmest line \nHide the Reference Line Header Right Click on Reference Line Axis > Uncheck Show header\n\nCreate another Calculated Field to show Country is Net Importer/Exporter in a particular year\nAnalysis > Create Calculated Field\n“Net Importer/Exporter”: IF[Total Import] > [Total Export] THEN “Net Importer” ELSE “Net Exporter” END\n\nDrag & Drop “Net Importer/Exporter” onto filter Choose all and click OK \nAnnotate Net Importer and Net Exporter onto chart\nRight click on an empty area in the chart > Annotate > Area\n\nDrag & Drop “Country” onto AGG(Total Import) > Label\nClick on Alignment and Select Middle for Vertical Section. This will display country label in the middle of the bubble\n\n5.0. Final Visualization\n5.1. Snapshot of Graph\n\n5.2. Major Observation and/or derived Insights\nBased on the data observed, Hong Kong has been consistently ranked as Singapore Top 1 Net Exporters from Year 2011 to 2020 and Indonesia is ranked Second in Net Exporters from 2011 to 2020 as well. Taiwan has gradually becoming one of Singapore Top Net Importers from 2011 to 2013 and has held Rank 1 for about 5 years before United States took it’s place in Rank 1 for 2 years.\nWhilst, Mainland China has been steadily ranked as the Singapore Top Importer and Exporter throughout the years, with the highest total merchandise trade values of more than $13 billions in the last 10 years, followed by Malaysia of more than $13 billions. Thailand on the other hand has the lowest total merchandise trade values of less than $4 billions.\n\n\n\n",

Alternative Design\n\n2.1. Advantages of proposed design\n2.1.1 Clarity\nTitle tells a better story of what is to be expected from the graph and subtitle is used to annotate the overall chart.\nInstead of raw import and export data, this graph uses of Net Export formula (Export - Import) to illustrate the impact of Import and Export trades.\nAdded units to x axis label to indicate the data is a monetary value.\n2.1.2 Aesthetics\nAesthetically, a simple line chart shows a better trends between the 6 countries.\nColor coordinated, with red indicating negative figures (Trade Deficit) and blue indicating positive figures (Trade Surplus).\nAnnotation is used to highlight key points.\nEach line is accompanied with a country label instead of showing it as a separate legend.\nY axis is not divided into 6 segments, trends can be spotted with the level of granularity for the time period\n3.0.

Data Visualization in Tableau\nImport the Excel Sheet into Tableau and select “Data” worksheet as Data Source\nChange Data Type\nChange ‘Period’ data type from String to Date\nChange ‘Import’ data type from String to Number (whole)\nChange ‘Export’ data type from String to Number (whole)\nCreate a calculate field to show Net Export\nUnder Analysis > ‘Create Calculated Field’ or Right Click on the left panel > ‘Create Calculated Field’\nInput Calculated Field ‘Net Export (S$)’ Formula:\nSUM([Import]) - SUM([Export])\nCreate a line chart to display Net Export from Year 2019 Jan to Year 2020 Dec\nDrag [Month(Period)] to Columns\nDrag [AGG(Net Export(S$))] to Rows\nSeparating Net Export data into Country level\nDrag [Country] into ‘Details’ and ‘Label’\nAdd colors to differentiate positive or negative net export\nDrag [AGG(Net Export(S$))] to ‘Color’ properties\nFormatting Colors\nOnce Step 5 is done, a color filter interface automatically appear in the right panel\nClick on the down arrow > Edit Colors…\nUnder Palette > Select ‘Red-Blue Diverging’\nCheck ‘Use Full Color Range’\nClick on Advance > Check Center and input 0 as the value\nAdd Annotation\nRight click on an empty space in the chart > Annotate > Area\n5.0. Final Visualization\n5.1. Snapshot of Graph\n\n5.2. Major Observation and/or derived Insights\nThere are 2 extreme trading trends gathered between Taiwan and Hong Kong.\nSingapore trading behavior with Taiwan within this period can assumed to have contributed to Singapore economic growth due to trade surplus. Taiwan main import goods are oil/petroleum and natural gas, in which happen to be Singapore main export goods. Taiwan main export goods are electrical equipment and machinery, however, Singapore are importing it more from other countries such as China, Malaysia and United States. Therefore, Singapore is importing less from Taiwan, and exporting more to Taiwan, creating trade surplus.\nOn the other hand, between 2019 to 2020, Singapore is experiencing trade deficit with Hong Kong. Hong Kong’s main exporting goods are electrical machinery, precious and minerals which Singapore needs. However, Hong Kong’s main imports goods are also machinery equipment which is largely provided by China and Singapore only stands a small percentage of the total export trade. This result in inflow of import goods exceeded the outflow of export goods and this create trade deficit.\nObservatory of Economic Complexity, 2019Singapore Import and Export data, 2019\n\n\n\n",

The data set consists of 13 variables and 6497 observations. For the purpose of this exercise, we have combined the red wine and white wine data into one data file. It is called wine_quality and is in csv file format.\n3.1 Importing Data\nFirst, let us import the data into R by using read_csv() of readr package.\nR code\nwine <- read_csv(“data/wine_quality.csv”)\nNotice that beside quality and type, the rest of the variables are numerical and continuous data type.\n4.0 Univariate EDA with Histogram\nIn the figure below, multiple histograms are plottted by using ggplot() and geom_histogram() of ggplot2 package. Then, ggarrange() of ggpubr package is used to patch these histogram into a single figure to reveal the distribution of the selected variables in the wine quality data sets.\nRcode\nfa <- ggplot(data=wine, aes(x= fixed acidity)) + geom_histogram(bins=20, color=“black”, fill=“light blue”) va <- ggplot(data=wine, aes(x= volatile acidity)) + geom_histogram(bins=20, color=“black”, fill=“light blue”) ca <- ggplot(data=wine, aes(x= citric acid)) + geom_histogram(bins=20, color=“black”, fill=“light blue”) rs <- ggplot(data=wine, aes(x= residual sugar)) + geom_histogram(bins=20, color=“black”, fill=“light blue”) ch <- ggplot(data=wine, aes(x= chlorides)) + geom_histogram(bins=20, color=“black”, fill=“light blue”) fSO2 <- ggplot(data=wine, aes(x= free sulfur dioxide)) + geom_histogram(bins=20, color=“black”, fill=“light blue”) tSO2 <- ggplot(data=wine, aes(x= total sulfur dioxide)) + geom_histogram(bins=20, color=“black”, fill=“light blue”) density <- ggplot(data=wine, aes(x= density)) + geom_histogram(bins=20, color=“black”, fill=“light blue”) pH <- ggplot(data=wine, aes(x= pH)) + geom_histogram(bins=20, color=“black”, fill=“light blue”) sulphates <- ggplot(data=wine, aes(x= sulphates)) + geom_histogram(bins=20, color=“black”, fill=“light blue”) alcohol <- ggplot(data=wine, aes(x= alcohol)) + geom_histogram(bins=20, color=“black”, fill=“light blue”)\nggarrange(fa, va, ca, rs, ch, fSO2, tSO2, density, pH, sulphates, alcohol, ncol = 4, nrow = 3)\n\n\n\n",
